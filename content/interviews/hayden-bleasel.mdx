## To start off, could you tell us a bit about yourself and how you first got started in this field?

## You've described yourself as both a designer and engineer. How do you navigate that intersection, and do you find yourself leaning more toward one side depending on the project?

## You recently co-authored [components.build](https://components.build) with shadcn—a formal specification for building modern UI components. What are the goals of the project, and what do you hope people take from it?

## In the components.build spec, what principles do you consider most critical but often overlooked by component library authors?

## What's your philosophy on when to build a new component versus when to provide composition utilities that let developers build it themselves?

## The AI SDK ecosystem is evolving rapidly. How do you think about building components that remain flexible as AI capabilities and patterns continue to change?

## You've built component libraries both within large organizations and as open source projects. How does the approach differ between building for internal teams versus the broader community?

## You've mentioned loving to design "minimal, elegant library APIs." What makes an API elegant to you, and can you give an example of one you're particularly proud of?

## What trends in component design and frontend development are you most excited about right now?
